This project is a voice-controlled AI assistant named Jarvis, developed using Python and powered by the OpenAI API. It combines speech recognition, AI-generated text and voice output to create an interactive assistant capable of natural language conversations. Users communicate with Jarvis via a microphone and their speech is converted into text using the SpeechRecognition library. The text is then sent to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 model and the AI’s response is spoken aloud using the system’s text-to-speech capabilities. This setup enables fluid, real-time interaction with the assistant.

Jarvis supports multiple functionalities, including conversational chatting, prompt-based generation and system-level voice commands. The chat mode maintains a context-aware dialogue history, enabling more coherent and intelligent conversations. In cases where the command includes “Using artificial intelligence,” the assistant switches to a prompt mode that generates and saves responses in neatly formatted .txt files. Beyond AI conversation, Jarvis can perform tasks like opening websites (YouTube, Google, Wikipedia), launching local applications (e.g., FaceTime, Passky), playing music and reporting the current time, making it a handy personal assistant for everyday use.

A separate script (openaitest.py) is included to test the OpenAI API’s functionality, demonstrating its use in generating content such as emails. The code is modular and organized, making it easy to expand by adding more voice commands or improving AI interaction features. Placeholder paths and voice responses can be customized for different systems. Overall, this project demonstrates a practical and educational implementation of artificial intelligence, showcasing how generative models can be embedded into real-time voice applications to simplify tasks and enhance user experience.
